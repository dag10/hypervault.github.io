        <h1>What is Hypervault?</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypervault is a file encryption app meant to provide data-at-rest encryption.</li>
          <li>Hypervault is entirely contained in a single .html file. As such, you can save the Hypervault page, and you will have a complete working copy of Hypervault which you can run offline.</li>
          <li>Hypervault outputs another single .html file which contains both the encrypted file data, and a copy of itself.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>What Hypervault is NOT?</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypervault does NOT provide data-in-transit security. So if you want to transfer a Hypervault, make sure you transfer it over a secured mechanism (like SSL-encrypted email).</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Supported browsers?</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>It seems to work in most modern desktop browsers</li>
          <li>iOS support is coming soon</li>
          <li>Android is not yet tested</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>How do I use Hypervault?</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>Drag files you want to encrypt into it</li>
          <li>Choose a password with which to lock the hypervault (encrypt the files).</li>
          <li>Click "Lock vault"</li>
          <li>A "locked hypervault" will download to your computer containing your encrypted file data. This can be stored
        </ol>

        <h1>What is a locked vault?</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>A locked vault is a self-contained HTML file which contains both a copy of the Hypervault software and your encrypted file data.</li>
          <li>You can simply open a locked vault in a browser and enter your password to decrypt and recover your files.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>What's awesome about Hypervault?</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Secure
            <ul>
              <li>Hypervault uses the <a href="https://github.com/keybase/triplesec">Triplesec</a> library, which uses 3 strong encryption algorithms (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20">Salsa20</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)">Blowfish</a>), so you can rest assured that your data is safe, even if a couple of the ciphers are compromised.</li>
              <li>Since Hypervault runs in a browser (which is sandboxed), you never have to worry that it doing anything nefarious on your computer.</li>
              <li>Zero-knowledge: Hypervault encryption is all client-side, so even if Hypervault's servers are compromised, your data is still safe.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Easy
            <ul>
              <li>No installations necessary, just run in the browser.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Offline
            <ul>
              <li>Since Hypervault is a self-contained HTML file, you save it to your desktop and run it offline.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Always usable
            <ul>
              <li>Since Hypervault packages itself with your encrypted data (in the form of a "locked_vault.html" file, you can always decrypt your data, even if Hypervault goes away.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
